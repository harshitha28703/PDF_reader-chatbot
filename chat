Hi Ramesh,
Just wanted to let you know my exam schedule in advance. I have exams on 29th & 30th September, and then on 1st & 2nd December. From 22nd December onwards, my SEE exams will start. In between, I might also have some practical exams (dates not yet announced). Iâ€™ll update you as soon as I get the exact dates.
